ALGORITHM:

1. Generate Random Number: Uses rand() % 100 + 1 to pick a number between 1 and 100.


2. Loop Until Correct Guess: The user keeps guessing until they find the number.


3. Provide Hints: Displays "Higher" or "Lower" based on the guess.


4. Efficient & Short Code: Uses a while (1) loop and breaks when the correct number is guessed.
